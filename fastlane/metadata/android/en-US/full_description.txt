Swyp Launcher is a digital assistant application that serves as a launcher to launch apps quickly from anywhere without minimizing or leaving what you are currently doing. The app provides four distinct interaction modes (handwriting, index, keyboard, and voice) optimized for single-handed operation. All UI elements are positioned at the bottom half of the screen for easy thumb access. It's completely free and all four modes run locally without any internet connection.
